Playing DOTA with so called "Russia trolls". Over time it started to seem that most games I play have Russia trolls. Maybe every one. A "Russia troll" in this context is a civilian recruit for the Russian security services, and they can be from anywhere, and of any ethnicity. They are not necessarily Russian, and are not actual members of staff for the Russian intelligence community. I am currently rated in the lowest 3/10000 of the playerbase, In this competitive online video game of DOTA2. At the literal minimum rating of 10 MMR. This is 3 or more standard deviations below the median rating. Typically as I have played online games I've rated in the [+1,+3] range in terms of standard deviations. In fact initially when I started this game for the first time, I calibrated as Herald IV. Not impressive, but hey it was my first time playing this game. Soon after I started getting this trolling from the Russians, and recalibrated.
